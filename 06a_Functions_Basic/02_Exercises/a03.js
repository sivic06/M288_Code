/*
Task: Mark Tool for linear grade calculation
a) Program a function that determines a grade based
on the achieved points with a linear grade scale. The formula is
     Grade = (points achieved / max points) * 5 + 1
b) Add a text to the grade as follows:
If the grade is >= 4.0, then the grade is 'sufficient',
otherwise 'unsatisfactory'.
c) Implement the tool user-friendly, i.e.

λ node a01-A.js
=========================================
Mark tool
=========================================

(C)alculate or (E)xit? c
What are maximum achievable points? 21
How many points has achieved the student? 9
You achieved 9 of 21 points and an insufficient mark 3.14!
(C)alculate or (E)xit? c
What are maximum achievable points? 11
How many points has achieved the student? 18
You achieved 18 of 11 points and a sufficient mark 9.18!
(C)alculate or (E)xit? e
